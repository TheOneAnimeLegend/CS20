- Making a Table: rows, colspan, rowspan (i.e. weekly schedule)
- Adding CSS to Table: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_table.asp
- More CSS: https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_tables.asp
- Example cell: font, font weight, color, background-color
- Note: background-color changes can increase contrast, making reading easier (not on white background)
- Note: in aXe validator, will analyze color contrast in Learn More
- Note: Checking Accessibility
