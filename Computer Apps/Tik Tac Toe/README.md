## Introduction

A Simpler Case Study: the maths of Tic Tak Toe
- Understanding choices and prediction, making a user experience of ethics (when to win)

"How do you program a computer to make ethical choices?"
- Learning how to play Tik Tac Toe
- When do you make yourself less of a master than you really are? When you are playing a child? When you are giving someone else a chance?

---

## Play the Game

Play the Game, review simple rules
- Using ethical choices of agreeing to play at the Easy, Medium, or Master Levels (another way of agreeing on ethics to guide behaviour)
- See Google Chrome's Built in Tic Tak Toe Game, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tic+tac+toe">Click Here</a>
  - What separates easy, medium, and impossible

- What strategy is being used here

Review a Blunt-force Algorithm for a small sample set allowing a computer to choose whether it wins or looses
- Review Images, start with CenterCourner to imagine a chart, <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O1aSlk_9VjMnE-fRP08UMWqMBG0YpssY">Click Here for a Google Drive Folder</a>
- "Half way through Mr. Mercer, I started to realize some moves where all the same, so I didn't include those."

  - Strategy: “3 corners” (one general pattern to ensure a win)
  - Discusses general probabilities based on corner moves and side moves

  - Strategy: “3 Corners”, “2-types of triangles”
  - Discusses different strategies but allows students to reflect on what is happening
  - Note: no sound on this

  - Strategy: Separates an Algorithm into different sections
    - 4:45 – 7:30: 3 in a row: discusses examples of how simple mistakes might be made, watch how he makes example 3 (general pattern) and example 4 (almost a general pattern)
    - 9:30 - ?? (about 13:00): Discusses two rules: when there is 2 in a row, try to make three or try to block
      - Code this with random() until the algorithm is able to be played
    - 14:00 - 15:30 (can stop about): Double Threats; discusses some advanced planning to set up a double threat
    - 20:00 - 23:30: Discusses how to setup and prevent double threats
    - 24:00 - 31:10 : Discusses how to setup a double threat

## General Algorithm From Mr. Wildberger

Notice: we start at the end of the game first, then get more specific to prediction (same with learning, if you know the goal ...)

Level 1
  - Rule 1: If you can make three, do so
  - Rule 2: If your opponent can make three next turn, prevent it

Level 2
  - Rule 3: If you can make a double threat, do so
  - Rule 4: If your opponent can make a double threat next turn, prevent it

Level 3
  - Rule 5: If you can set up a double threat next turn, do so
  - Rule 6: If you can prevent your opponent from setting up a double threat, do so

## Case Study: Simple GUI

Using Lines
- Easy to calculate endpoints
- Easy to separate Canvas into Divisions
- First Endpoint of line is the first coordinate of a rectangle for images, text or button
- See: GUI Design / Prototyping / Lines / Lines.pde (<a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/CS20/tree/master/Computer%20Apps/Tik%20Tac%20Toe/GUI%20Design/Prototyping">Click Here</a>)

Using Lines and Rectangles (<a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/CS20/tree/master/Computer%20Apps/Tik%20Tac%20Toe/GUI%20Design/Prototyping">Click Here</a>)
- Rectangles are used to draw text or images

Reviewing Processing-Java: drawing text to the canvas
- See CS10, <a href="">Click Here</a>
Create Button or Key Board interaction that draws X's and O's into spaces
- Image or Text

# Ideas to Include

5. General Flow Chart
   - Draw GUI with individual Elements
   - AI will play second always
     - Randomly on every turn (will be used to test more complicated algorithms)
     - Randomly until sees two in a "row" to win or two in a row to prevent (can be separated)
       - Use random to set how many times a win will happen at medium level or easy level
       - For example, best move is always played at Mastery Level
       - For example, medium level uses score and does not let score become more than 2
       - For example, easy level uses score and does not let score become more than 4
     - Randomly on the first turn, then chooses response to "Double Threat" shape (create a .pdf of all Double Threat Shapes)
   - AI will play first or second
     - Separate math for center, corners, or sides

6. Case Study a Simple GUI knowing all the coded pieces of a board
   - Draw simple GUI with lines (coordinates and ratios, use paper folding)
     - Try to Upload a simple .pdf consumable of what this looks like
     - Smallest version of Divisions is 1/12: includes all fractions except 1/5 and 1/7 (note: might be a good idea to include 1/5 divisions)
   - Use Processing.Java to layout the divisions, with lines and rectangles (in order), start with largest DIVs first
     - Test fullScreen() and size() in landscape and portrait
     - Chart all values, is there a better way to print this using FOR Loops
   - Create a To Do List with Object or Behaviour Prototyped Programs

7. Prototype
   - Review Loading an Image to a rectangle, checking the side lengths
     - Find Downloadable X&O Images
     - See
   - Review drawing letters (X & O), checking font size
     - Must review loading a font
   - Review making buttons: quit button
   - Make clickable button with hover-over
     - Need to turn off button when something drawn there (Boolean Decision)
   - Decide how to play:
     - First play is X, and then alternates
   - How will the be tested in the console?

Ideas:
- Algorithm to solve Tiling Problem: find squares in a rectangle
- Algorithm to solve Tic Tack Toe Board in square (based on paper folding)
- Creating algorithm to calculate then self-finish

Learning about 3 in a row
- use modulus on count

New Coding
- parsing integers to strings
  Showing the number of xWins and yWins
- Text follows different algoroithm
  textSize is larger than rect height when textWidth is shorter than rect width
  take percentage of that font
-

Reset
- Index to null
- Count to zero
- noDraw[] to false with FOR Loop
