# JavaScript Lessons
Brief Order of Pathways

**Under Construction**

JavaScript Introductions
- Create 10 Variables
- Swapping Variables
- Operators

JavaScript Only Assignments
- Assignment Order of Teaching
  - Modulus Assignment: Review arrays and decisions, also review modulus operator to evaluate even and odd numbers
  - Greeting Someone (based on the hour of the day): Reviews issues with decisions
  - Max of Two Numbers: Reviews decisions in terms of comparisons
  - Landscape or Portrait: Reviews ternary operator and how to write very few lines of code
  - FizzBuzz: ordering "RETURN" logic with a problem situation common in blogs
  - Ordering Grades: easier ordering "RETURN" Logic
  - Demerit Points: ordering "RETURN" Logic
- Assignment order for those struggling with JavaScript (ordered according to coding difficulty illustrated in notes)
  - Landscape or Portrait: beginning and advanced code is given
  - Max of Two Numbers: beginning code is given and uses advanced code from "Landscape or Portrait"
  - Modulus Assignment: Using Modulus, combine code from "Landscape or Portrait" and "Max of Two Numbers"
  - Ordering Grades: using if and return keywords to design functions, concrete example
  - Demerit Points: using if and return keywords to design functions, concrete example with simple arithmetic
  - FizzBuzz: using if and return keywords to design functions, abstract example
  - Greeting Someone: using an analogue clock and design feedback, use any assignment

Basic Form Introduction and JavaScript Interactions
- Basic Form, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/CS20/tree/master/Websites/Intermediate%20Boilerplate/Basic%20Form%20Collection">Click Here</a>
- Minimum Assignments to Combine into a Website
  - Landscape or Portrait
  - Maximum of Two Numbers
  - (One of) Ordering Grades | Demerit Points | FizzBuzz
  - (One of) Modulus Assignment | FizzBuzz | Greeting Someone
- Maximum: design a website to combine all assignments
- Of course, options include anything in-between

# Ideas
Include index.html & index.js for all assignments not finished,
remember, these are the starter code assignments, not the finished products

Assignments should be formatted like

Problem Situation -
- Input
- Logic Of Situation
  - a
- a

Output to the Console
- a

Case Study Details
- Test Cases (boundaries of the Problem Situation)

Developing the Algorithm
- a

Starter Code to Consider
- a

Reminder: use the tertiary operator

# Ideas
Add the following JavaScript Assignments

See: <a href="https://github.com/QEHS-Websites/JavaScript-Sandbox/tree/master/IOP%20Computational%20Exercises#landscape-or-portrait">Click Here</a>
- Prime Numbers
- Even and Odd Numbers
- Count Truthy
- String Properties in an Object
- Sum of Multiples of 3 and 5
- Stars

Need a better way of introducing a lot of the arithmetic tracking
- handout like in math 1/2 page or 1 page?

Need better sequence to JavaScript Lessons
- Build code (functions, arrays, variables, constants, IF statements and importance of TRUE, order of RETURN)
- Build "arithmetic echoes"

Need to Map the Answers, especially the given code in the ReadMe.md File describing each .js assignment
- students need to understand the flow of the problem to translate the maths to code
