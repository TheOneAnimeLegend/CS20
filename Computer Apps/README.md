# Ideas to Include

Exploring Games and AI, creating an algorithm to deal with probabilities
- A Simpler Case Study: the maths of Tic Tak Toe
- Understanding choices and prediction, making a user experience of ethics (when to win)

"How do you program a computer to make ethical choices?"
- Learning how to play Tik Tac Toe
- When do you make yourself less of a master than you really are? When you are playing a child? When you are giving someone else a chance?

Steps in Creating a Case Study (Playing Tik Tac Toe) with Probabilities
1. Play the Game, review simple rules
   - Using ethical choices of agreeing to play at the Easy, Medium, or Master Levels (another way of agreeing on ethics to guide behaviour)
2. Review a Blunt-force Algorithm for a small sample set allowing a computer to choose whether it wins or looses
   - Review Images, start with CenterCourner to imagine a chart
   - "Half way through Mr. Mercer, I started to realize some moves where all the same, so I didn't include those."
3. Develop an algorithm with these Videos
   - Reminder: for each video, name the strategy to develop an algorithm to
   - Video: Master Strategies, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n2aQ3UQu9Y">Click Here</a>
     - Strategy: “3 corners” (one general pattern to ensure a win)
     - Discusses general probabilities based on corner moves and side moves
   - Video: Secrets and Strategies, <a href="">Click Here to see the Google Drive Video</a>
     - Strategy: “3 Corners”, “2-types of triangles”
     - Discusses different strategies but allows students to reflect on what is happening
     - Note: no sound on this
   - Video: ElemMath 13.mp4, <a href="">Click Here to see the Google Drive Video</a>
     - Strategy: Separates an Algorithm into different sections
       - 4:45 – 7:30: 3 in a row
         - Discusses examples of how simple mistakes might be made, watch how he makes example 3 (general pattern) and example 4 (almost a general pattern)
       - 9:30 - ?? (about 13:00): Discusses two rules: when there is 2 in a row, try to make three or try to block
         - Code this with random() until the algorithm is able to be played
       - 14:00 - 15:30 (can stop about): Double Threats; discusses some advanced planning to set up a double threat
       - 20:00 - 23:30: Discusses how to setup and prevent double threats
       - 24:00 - 31:10 : Discusses how to setup a double threat
     - General Algorithm From Mr. Wildberger
       - Level 1
         - Rule 1: If you can make three, do so
         - Rule 2: If your opponent can make three next turn, prevent it
       - Level 2
         - Rule 3: If you can make a double threat, do so
         - Rule 4: If your opponent can make a double threat next turn, prevent it
       - Level 3
         - Rule 5: If you can set up a double threat next turn, do so
         - Rule 6: If you can prevent your opponent from setting up a double threat, do so
4. Generalize your algorithm with these readings
